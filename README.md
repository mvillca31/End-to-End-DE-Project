# YouTube Video Analysis Data Engineering Project

#Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering solution designed and executed for YouTube video analysis. The solution encompasses data ingestion, transformation, storage, and reporting, leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalable cloud-based data processing and centralized data management. The project aims to enhance data quality, usability, and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

# Project Highlights

Data Engineering Solution: Designed and executed a comprehensive data engineering solution, covering all aspects from data ingestion to reporting.

Robust ETL Processes: Implemented robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to transform raw data into a structured format, significantly improving data quality and usability.

Scalable AWS Infrastructure: Leveraged Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure scalable and cloud-based data processing capabilities, making the system capable of handling growing data volumes.

Interactive Data Visualization: Created an interactive dashboard using Amazon QuickSight for data visualization, enabling stakeholders to extract actionable insights from the data.

Centralized Data Storage: Centralized data storage in Amazon S3 and utilized AWS services like Glue, Lambda, and Athena for streamlined data management, processing, and analysis.

# Services used in this Project

Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.

AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.

AWS Lambda: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.

AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
